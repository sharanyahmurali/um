                <p>Hi, your friends in Bangalore all miss you so very much. It's almost weird to think how much time we've all spent together.  Anyway, in all our time together there are so many standout moments. We've been a few different places, eaten a few different things and drank a questionable amount of different notorious fluids. However, from all those moments, we're leaving this standout here.</p>

                <p>See I never thought that I could walk through fire; I never thought that I could take the burn. I never had the strength to take it higher. Until I reached the point of no return. You're probably reading this thinking this is a very meaningful birthday message, actually it's Justin Bieber's 2010 hit song <strong>Never Say Never</strong> ft. Jaden Smith. Anyway, And there's just no turning back When your heart's under attack Gonna give everything I have It's my destiny I will never say never! (I will fight) I will fight till forever! (Make it right) Whenever you knock me down I will not stay on the ground Pick it up Pick it up Pick it up Pick it up, up, up And never say never Ne-never say never (never) Ne-never say never (never) Ne-never say never (never). Thank you.</p>
